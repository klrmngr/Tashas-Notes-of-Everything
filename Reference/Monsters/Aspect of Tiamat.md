### Traits

**Chromatic Wrath (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If the aspect would be reduced to 0 hit points, her current hit point total instead resets to 500 hit points, she recharges her Chromatic Flames, and she regains any expended uses of Legendary Resistance. Additionally, the aspect can now use the options in the "Mythic Actions" section for 1 hour. Award a party an additional 155,000 XP (310,000 XP total) for defeating the aspect of Tiamat after her Chromatic Wrath activates.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).** If the aspect fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The aspect makes one Bite attack, one Claw attack, and one Tail attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (2d12 + 10) piercing damage plus 19 (3d12) force damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (2d10 + 10) slashing damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20) and is restrained until this grapple ends. The aspect can have only one creature grappled this way at a time.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (2d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 27 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Chromatic Flames (Recharge 5–6).** The aspect exhales multicolored flames in a 300-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 71 (11d12) damage of a type of the aspect's choosing: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

**Attack.** The aspect makes one Claw or Tail attack.

If the aspect's Chromatic Wrath trait has activated in the last hour, she can use the options below as legendary actions.
