### Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The satyr has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Sleepless Reveler.** Magic can't put the satyr to sleep.


---

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The satyr makes three ram attacks or three shortbow attacks.

**Ram.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (2d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.

**Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

**Hail of Arrows (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The satyr fires an arrow that magically transforms into a flurry of missiles in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
