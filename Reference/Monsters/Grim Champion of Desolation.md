### Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the champion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


---

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The champion makes two Leeching Blade attacks and uses Hollow Void.

**Leeching Blade.** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 33 (6d10) cold damage, and the champion regains 10 hit points.

**Hollow Void.** The champion summons a hungering rift around a creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The creature must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 49 (11d8) force damage and has the stunned condition until the start of the champion's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this effect, the creature dies, and its body crumbles to dust.


---

### Bonus Actions

**Step into Nothing (Recharge 4–6).** The champion, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, has the invisible condition and teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of itself. The champion remains invisible until the start of its next turn or immediately after it deals damage.


---

### Legendary Actions

### 

**Crush.** The champion unleashes a burst of crushing force on a creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The creature must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or take 14 (4d6) force damage and have the prone condition.

**Fearsome Pursuit.** The champion moves up to its speed or commands its mount to move up to its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

**Nullify (Costs 2 Actions).** The champion emits a magic wave in a 60-foot cone. Every spell of 5th level or lower ends on creatures and objects of the champion's choice in that area.
