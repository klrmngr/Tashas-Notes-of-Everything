### Traits

**Glacial Aura.** At the end of the borthak's turn, slippery ice covers surfaces within 10 feet of the borthak. This ice is difficult terrain. When a creature other than the borthak enters the ice's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or have the prone condition. The ice disappears at the start of the borthak's next turn.

**Webbed Feet.** The borthak can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.


---

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The borthak makes one Bite attack or uses Noxious Regurgitation if available, and it makes two Stomp attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage.

**Stomp.** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (1d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Noxious Regurgitation (Recharge 5–6).** The borthak spews acid at a creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 24 (7d6) acid damage and has the poisoned condition until the start of the borthak's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.


---

### Reactions

**Reactive Tail.** When a creature within 10 feet of the borthak hits the borthak with an attack roll, the borthak swings its tail in retaliation. The triggering creature and any creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

### Legendary Actions

**Move.** The borthak moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
