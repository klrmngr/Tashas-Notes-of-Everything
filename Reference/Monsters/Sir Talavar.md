### Traits

**Superior Invisibility.** As a bonus action, Sir Talavar can magically turn invisible until his concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment Sir Talavar wears or carries is invisible with him.

**Magic Resistance.** Sir Talavar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

**+1 Tiny Sword.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d4 + 6) piercing damage.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage.

**Euphoria Breath (Recharge 5–6).** Sir Talavar exhales a puff of euphoria gas at one creature within 5 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a d6 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior during the turn:
- **1-4.** The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.
- **5-6.** The target doesn't move, and the only thing it can do on its turn is make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
