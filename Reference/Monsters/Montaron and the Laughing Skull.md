### Traits

**Assassinate.** During his first turn, Montaron has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Montaron scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

**Evasion.** If Montaron is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Montaron instead takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if he fails.

**Nimbleness.** Montaron can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than his.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** Montaron deals an extra 21 (6d6) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Montaron that isn't incapacitated and Montaron doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Special Equipment.** Montaron possesses a bag of holding. He keeps the demilich, Xzar, in the bag. He also possesses a portable hole, which he uses to aid in robberies. As a bonus action, Montaron can place his portable hole in his bag of holding. This instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. Montaron and any creature within 10 feet of him is sucked through the gate to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Montaron makes three Shortsword attacks and uses the ability Unleash the Demilich if available.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage.

**Unleash the Demilich (1/Day).** Montaron reaches inside his bag of holding and releases Xzar. Xzar is a demilich and appears within 5 feet of Montaron. Xzar rolls for his own initiative. Xzar can't use lair actions or legendary actions. He has a CR of 14.
