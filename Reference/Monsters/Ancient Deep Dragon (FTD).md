### Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


---

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) poison damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Change Shape.** The dragon magically transforms into any creature that is Medium or Small, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses its action to end it.

**Nightmare Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon exhales a cloud of spores in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 49 (9d10) psychic damage, and it is frightened of the dragon for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Legendary Actions

### 

**Commanding Spores.** The dragon releases spores around a creature within 30 feet of it that it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against a random creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, or the target can't take a reaction, it takes 11 (2d10) psychic damage.

**Tail.** The dragon makes one Tail attack.

**Spore Salvo (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon releases poisonous spores around a creature within 30 feet of it that it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (8d6) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
