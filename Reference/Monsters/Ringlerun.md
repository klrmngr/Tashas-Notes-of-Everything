### Traits

**Special Equipment.** Ringlerun wields a staff of power. It has 20 charges when fully charged and regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If its last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses its other properties; on a 20, it regains 1d8 + 2 charges.
