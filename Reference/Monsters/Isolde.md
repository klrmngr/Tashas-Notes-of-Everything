### Traits

**Fiendish Blessing.** The AC of Isolde includes her Charisma bonus.

**Magic Resistance Aura.** While holding Nepenthe, Isolde creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around her. While this aura is active, Isolde and all creatures friendly to her in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


---

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Isolde makes two melee attacks or uses its Fire Ray twice.

**Nepenthe.** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft.., one target. *Hit:* 11 (1d8 + 7) slashing damage, or 12 (1d10 + 7) slashing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack. If the target is a fiend or an undead, it takes an extra 11 (2d10) radiant damage.

**Fire Ray.** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) fire damage.

**Fiendish Charm.** One humanoid Isolde can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys Isolde's spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm from Isolde or another creature or receives a suicidal command from Isolde, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Isolde's Fiendish Charm for the next 24 hours.
