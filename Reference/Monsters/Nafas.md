### Traits

**Dimensionally Bound.** Nafas can't leave the Infinite Staircase or be trapped within a container (such as an Iron Flask). Attempts to transport Nafas to another plane are wasted.

**Last Wish.** When Nafas drops to 0 hit points, his body disintegrates into a whirl of multiversal dust that surrounds one creature responsible for his demise. That creature then hears Nafas's last wish: for the creature to take his place.
If the creature accepts, it is transformed into a noble djinni. The creature's game statistics are replaced by those of Nafas (including this trait), though it retains its name, alignment, and personality. The creature also inherits Nafas's palace and all it contains.
If the creature refuses, Nafas gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all his hit points and appearing in a random safe location on the Infinite Staircase.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).** If Nafas fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Nafas has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Noble Genie.** Nafas doesn't suffer any of the penalties that normally follow casting the Wish spell to produce an effect other than duplicating another spell.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Nafas makes three Storm Shamshir attacks and uses Create Vortex.

**Storm Shamshir.** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) lightning or thunder damage (Nafas's choice).

**Create Vortex.** A 10-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder of swirling cosmic dust forms on a point Nafas can see within 120 feet of him. The vortex lasts as long as Nafas maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). When the vortex appears, each creature other than Nafas in the vortex's area must make a DC 22 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8) force damage and has the restrained condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only and moves to the nearest unoccupied space outside the vortex.
On subsequent turns, Nafas can use this action to move the vortex up to 60 feet. When the vortex enters a creature's space for the first time on a turn, the creature must make the same saving throw as when the vortex first appeared. Creatures restrained by the vortex move with it.
A creature restrained by the vortex, or another creature that can reach it, can use its action to make a DC 22 Strength check. On a successful check, the restrained creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest unoccupied space outside the vortex.

### Reactions

**Blowback.** Immediately after a creature Nafas can see ends its turn, Nafas exhales forceful winds in a 30-foot cone. Large or smaller creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from him.

**Zephyr Step.** In response to being hit by an attack roll, Nafas moves up to half his flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
