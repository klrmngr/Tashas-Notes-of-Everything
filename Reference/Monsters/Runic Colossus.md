### Traits

**Immutable Form.** The colossus is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance.** The colossus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The colossus deals double damage to objects and structures.


---

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The colossus makes two Slam attacks and then uses Stomp.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Stomp.** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 29 (4d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or have the prone condition. Until the colossus uses its Stomp again or moves, the creature has the restrained condition. The restrained creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can use its action to make a DC 22 Strength check. On a successful check, the affected creature relocates to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the colossus and is no longer restrained.

**Arcane Beam (Recharge 5–6).** The colossus fires a beam of magical force from its chest, hands, or head in a 150-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 58 (9d12) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

**Spell Reflection (2/Day).** Ranged Spell Attack: +14 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature casting a spell of 5th level or lower. *Hit:* 26 (4d12) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or the spell fails and has no effect.
