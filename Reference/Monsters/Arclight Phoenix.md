### Traits

**Flyby.** The arclight phoenix doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Grounded Lightning.** The first time on a turn that the arclight phoenix touches the ground, it takes 11 (2d10) force damage.

**Illumination.** The arclight phoenix sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.

**Lightning Form.** The arclight phoenix can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the phoenix or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage. In addition, the arclight phoenix can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage.

**Crackling Death.** When the arclight phoenix dies, it explodes. Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion destroys the phoenix but leaves behind a Tiny, warm egg with a mizzium shell. The egg contains the embryo of a new arclight phoenix. It hatches when it is in the area of a spell that deals lightning damage, or if a creature touches the egg and expends spell slots whose combined levels equal 13 or more. When it hatches, the egg releases a new arclight phoenix that appears in the egg's space.

### Actions

**Arclight Touch.** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (6d8) lightning damage, and lightning jumps from the target to one creature of the phoenix's choice that it can see within 30 feet of the target. That second creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 27 (6d8) lightning damage.
