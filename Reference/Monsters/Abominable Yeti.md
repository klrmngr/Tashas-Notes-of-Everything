### Traits

**Fear of Fire.** If the yeti takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

**Keen Smell.** The yeti has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

**Snow Camouflage.** The yeti has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain.


---

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The yeti can use its Chilling Gaze and makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.

**Chilling Gaze.** The yeti targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the yeti, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 21 (6d6) cold damage and then be paralyzed for 1 minute, unless it is immune to cold damage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to this yeti's gaze for 1 hour.

**Cold Breath (Recharge 6).** The yeti exhales a 30-foot cone of frigid air. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
