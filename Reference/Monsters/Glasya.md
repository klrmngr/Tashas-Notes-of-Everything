### Traits

**Charm Aura.** When a creature moves to be within 120 feet of Glasya, they must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or have the charmed condition, treating Glasya as an ally, until they leave the aura. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to this effect for 1 hour. Whenever a charmed creature takes damage, they may repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

**Dominating Presence.** Glasya deals an additional 13 (2d12) psychic damage when attacking a charmed creature, and her attacks don't break charms.

**Fiendish Regeneration.** Glasya regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn. If she takes radiant damage this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn. Glasya dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and is unable to regenerate. If Glasya is killed, her body slowly regenerates, returning to life 9 (2d8) weeks later.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Glasya fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Glasya has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Glasya makes four attacks using Scourge of Shadow, Necrotic Grasp, or a combination of the two. She can replace one of the attacks with Mesmerizing Gaze.

**Scourge of Shadow.** Melee Weapon Attack: +20 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (3d4 + 12) slashing damage, plus 5 (2d4) necrotic damage. This attack scores a critical on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.

**Necrotic Grasp.** Glasya summons necrotic hands to grope and claw at a creature she can see within 90 feet of her. The target must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, taking 20 (2d10 + 9) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Mesmerizing Gaze.** Glasya focuses her gaze in a 60-foot cone in front of her. Each creature of her choice within the cone must make a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or have the charmed condition until the end of their next turn. While charmed, creatures automatically fail saving throws from abilities used by Glasya and move to be as close to her as possible.

**Deathly Exclamation (1/Day).** Glasya targets a creature she can see within 60 feet of her. The target must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, taking 61 (7d8 + 30) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid killed by this ability rises at the start of Glasya's next turn as a zombie permanently under her command.
