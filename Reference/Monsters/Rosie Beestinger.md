### Traits

**Brave.** Rosie has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Halfling Nimbleness.** Rosie can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than hers.

**Evasion.** If Rosie is subjected to an effect that allows her to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, she instead takes no damage if she succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if she fails. She can't use this trait if she's incapacitated.

**Shadow Step.** When Rosie is in dim light or darkness, she can use a bonus action to teleport 60 feet to an unoccupied space she can see that is also in dim light or darkness. She then has advantage on the first melee attack she makes before the end of the turn.


---

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Rosie makes three attacks, then makes two unarmed strike attacks.

**Staff of the Master (+1 Quarterstaff).** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.

**Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. Rosie's unarmed strikes are magical.


---

### Reactions

**Deflect Missiles.** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, Rosie deflects the missile. The damage she takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + 9. If the damage is reduced to 0, she catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and she has a hand free.
