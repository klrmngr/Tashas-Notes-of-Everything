**Rend.** Melee Weapon Attack: your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1d6 + 4 + summonSpellLevel piercing damage.

**Breath Weapon.** The dragon exhales destructive energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes 2d6 damage of a type this dragon has resistance to (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
