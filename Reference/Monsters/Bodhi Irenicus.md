### Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Bodhi fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Regeneration.** Bodhi regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight. If she takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.

**Rejuvenation.** If Bodhi is destroyed, her body immediately appears in her resting place. She is paralyzed until she regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 24 hours in her resting place with 0 hit points, she regains 1 hit point. While paralyzed in this manner, if a creature within 60 feet says her name 9 times, Bodhi is permanently destroyed.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** Bodhi deals an extra 28 (8d6) damage when she hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Bodhi that isn't incapacitated and Bodhi doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Spider Climb.** Bodhi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Summoned By Name (1/Day).** If a creature says Bodhi Irenicus's full name 9 times in a row, Bodhi hears her name and becomes aware of the creature. Bodhi knows the exact location and name of the creature that spoke her name. She can then choose, as a free action, to teleport to a location adjacent to the creature. She must choose to do this within 1 minute of hearing her name. This power works even if the creature is on a different plane of existence. 1 minute after teleporting, Bodhi teleports back to where she was located when she heard her name spoken. This occurs even if Bodhi is unwilling and even if she is in an antimagic effect.

**Vampire Weaknesses.** Bodhi Irenicus has the following flaws:
- Bodhi can't abide a song performed in the elvish language. A creature that can speak the elvish language can use an action to sing an elven song. If Bodhi is within 60 feet of the singer and can hear the song, she has disadvantage on attacks and saving throws.
- If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Bodhi's heart while she is incapacitated in her resting place, Bodhi is paralyzed until the stake is removed.
- Bodhi takes 20 radiant damage when she starts her turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

### Actions

**Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).** Bodhi makes three Unarmed Strike attacks, one of which can be a Bite attack instead.

**Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Bodhi can grapple a Medium-sized or smaller target (escape DC 18).

**Bite (Panther or Vampire Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Bodhi regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A Humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Bodhi's control.

**Change Shape.** If Bodhi isn't in sunlight, she can polymorph into a Medium panther or back into her true form. While in panther form, Bodhi Irenicus can't speak, her walking speed is 40 feet, and she has a climb speed of 30 feet. Her statistics, other than her size and speed, are unchanged. Anything she is wearing transforms with her, but nothing she is carrying does. She reverts to her true form if she dies.

**Charm.** Bodhi targets one Humanoid she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see Bodhi, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Bodhi. The charmed target regards Bodhi as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Bodhi's control, it takes Bodhi's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. Each time Bodhi or her allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Bodhi is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.
